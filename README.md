# Noodle
Rhymes with Moodle, an already well-known app for students :)
# Project description 
The goal of Noodle is to digitalize and modernize the school system by efficiently managing the teaching process and communication between all participants – students, teachers, principals and administrative staff. The problem being solved is the inefficient organization of school activities and communication, which can result in lost information, delays in schedule changes and limited access to important materials. This project provides an opportunity to expand out knowledge in resource managment systems, using external authentication services (OAuth2) and applying advance techniques in responsive web design.
